# RemoteMore Coding Challenge

Deezer is an internet-based music streaming service. You are required to implement a React/Node App to explore its database. Your Node server should wrap the Deezer API(https://api.deezer.com)
1. Users should be able to search for tracks. For every track found, show the artist and the duration of the track. On bigger screens with more available space, also include the name of the album.
2. Clicking/tapping the artists must allow users to see basic information about them, like its total number of fans. Also show its top 5 tracks along with a list of all their albums. For every album include the year in which it was released
Be sure to follow best practices and to demonstrate the skills youâ€™ve learnt to develop a modern web app. Keep in mind that our team intends to add more features to your code and that they expect this to be quick and easy for them to do.
Deploy your app online (preferably with Firebase), so it can be tested live online

# IMPORTANT
Most browsers enforce the same-origin restriction which may prevent HTTP calls to the Deezer API. To circumvent this problem and to enable CORS(Cross-origin resource sharing) in your app, simply forward requests through a public CORS proxy that adds the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to any OPTIONS preflight response.
For example when using the https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ proxy, then a call intended to https://api.deezer.com/search?q=eminem must become a call to https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://api.deezer.com/search?q=eminem in your code.
